        <p> There are many solutions out there for out healthcare problem, some promoted by the presidential candidates, other soltuions done by researchers. Here are some of solutions I found that I think could help the problem. </p>
        <P> From AMA(American Medical Assn.): Ensure adequate funding of the Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program and retain Medicaid expansion and implement expansion in more states, Stabilize individual insurance marketplaces and retain ACA market reform, Address physician shortages, Telehealth and remote patient monitoring (this one is important because it involves technology and making life easier), and Increase efficiency. These are all good ways to fix healthcare now but what about the long term? Most people point towards some type of universal healthcare. However getting something like this done is easier said then done. Polticians can't agree on how far universal healthcare should go and it's turned into a tedious partisan issue.  </p>
        <p>The problem always comes in when deciding how we would be paying for universal health care. For example in Bernie Sanders' plan we would be spending 3.5 trillion a year which is around the same level that the current health care system is spending. The problem is allocating costs. There's no easy soltuion to this giant problem but there are steps now to manage the issue until there is a solid solution, that's agreed upon.</p>
