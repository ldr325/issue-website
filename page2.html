          <p> The technology behind health insurance can at times feel retro. In some instances you still have to meet in person to set-up a healthcare plan or to hand in documents. It is also difficult to choose a healthcare plan without one of these specialists. Why? Because going online and trying to sign up for health insurance the langauge of the health care is full of jargon. It's difficult to understand without first knowing the terms. This was my experience at least last month when i tried to sign up for health insurance. And I was only trying to change my address, but the bureaucratic steps involved in every decision in health care makes everything uneccessarily difficult. </p>
          <p> In a study done by McKinsey & Company they found that In the United States, healthcare accounts for almost 18% of GDP  and 11% of employment, but the industry overall has been generally slow in adopting digital innovation. However the industry is making some strides and starting to develop technology to help customers. Although some of the problems they are encountering are a lack of digital talent to integrate new changes into the system.</p>
          <p> There are some ways tech has influenced health care already. In 3 areas mainly: better and more accessible treatment, improved care and efficiency, software improves healthcare and disease control. Tech has made health care accessible with new avenues to research potential doctors and towards health centers. Doctors and nurses are now also using tech in appointments to better track the health of the patients. This leads to improved care and more efficiency. Software much more recently has helped the WHO(World Helath Org) to better identify diseases around the world. </p>
          <p> There is still a lot of ways health care can become better through technology and make things easier for everyone. </p>
