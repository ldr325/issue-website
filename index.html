        <p> Health insurance is a complicated topic to talk about. Even the people who understand all the intricacies of it have hard time explaining it.  It dominates political discussions on health care, impacts decisions about insurance coverage, and ranks at the top of things Americans worry about. </p>
        <p> Some of the problems people face when dealing with health insurance are: difficulty affording the routine costs of health insurance, health care costs stop people from getting needed care or filling prescriptions, difficulty paying medical bills, and some populations experience the most difficulty with affording the cost of their health care and health insurance. Of course it is not limited to these issues alone. </p>
        <p> Not all the world faces the problems with health care as the US does. Many countires around the world have low cost or universal health care like Canada, Australia, Mexico, Denmark and many more. However here in the US we struggle with coming to terms with creating a basic universal health care. And it has been a main issue for politicians in the upcoming election and 2016's election. </p>
        <p> Some of the points that polticians try to hit on to resolve the health care issue are: out-of-control drug pricing, expading or decreasing Medicaid, and decreasing social barriers influencing health care. </p>
        <p> There's still a lot to be done to fix our broken health care system that is behind the times and doesn't treat everyone fairly. It is important to teach others how to understand the langauge surroudning health care and simplfying how health care is talked about. </p>
